	//
	//   - Serving.OnGetHeaders, ProcessGetHeadersMessage's unconditional reset

	//     max(BestHeaderSent, newHeaderSent)" — every getheaders reply
	//     overwrites it, never merges with what was there.
	//   - PeerManager.RelayBlock, SendBlockHeaders's own write right after it
	//     pushes the plain HEADERS message (net_processing.cpp:5372-5373 —
	//     verified by grepping every pindexBestHeaderSent site in the file
	//     rather than trusting a remembered line number; :5357 is the
	//     sibling compact-block branch this port does not take, Phase 4).
	//     A relay announcement is exactly as much "telling the peer about a
	//     header" as a getheaders reply is. This write is its OWN defect,
	//     not part of I1/I2's root cause: I1 was the dropped
	//     pindexBestKnownBlock branch and I2 was the absent parent test,
	//     both read-side; this write is what I2's parent test needs in
	//     order to see a PRIOR relay's headers send when it decides the
	//     NEXT block's hasParent (fix round 2, review Minor 2 correction).

	// by plain INV, which touches neither field (see relay.go relayCandidate's

	// (relay.go, manager.go RelayBlock), it is what makes "never announce to

	// same rule: whichever peer told us about a hash first (an inv, or the
	// block body itself) has that hash marked here before the relay for it
	// ever runs (manager.go Inv, BlockDone), and the relay marks it for

	// Sized for the STEADY-STATE case only — see knownBlockCap's own doc

	// itself: knownBlocks is documented as blocks-only by design (Task 12),

	// BlockDownloader.RequestTxs marks it for the peer that just announced
	// the hash back to us over the tx-inv round trip (the "peer already
	// told us they have it" half) — legacy's own peer.AddKnownInventory for
	// tx invs (netsync/manager.go:2371, run unconditionally once the
	// RUNNING gate has passed, BEFORE the headers-first check; see
	// RequestTxs' own doc comment for why that order matters). Before Task
	// 16 there was no peer-originated tx-inv path in this port at all, so

// looks like headroom for a catch-up burst.
//
// It is NOT a time-based bound, and the "48 hours" framing above is an
// average, not a floor: the cap is consumed per mark() call, and Inv (in
// manager.go) marks every InvTypeBlock entry in a single inbound MsgInv —
// up to wire.MaxInvPerMsg (50,000) entries in ONE message. A single large
// inv batch, exactly the "multi-block catch-up burst after a reconnect"
// case this comment used to cite as the reason for the headroom, can evict
// most or all of the set in one call, so the real worst-case protection
// window is "until the next big inv batch", which can be much shorter than
// 48 hours. The consequence stays bounded to a wasted small message either
// way — see relay.go's doc comments on hasBlock for why eviction is
// wasteful rather than harmful — so the number is kept, with this correction
// to what it actually guarantees.
//
// Each entry costs roughly 75-80 bytes, not the 32 bytes of a bare
// chainhash.Hash (fix round 2, review Minor 4 correction: knownBlockSet
// stores every hash TWICE — once as a map key, with the map's own

// dominated in practice by transactions, since blocks arrive roughly once
// every ten minutes and transactions arrive continuously. Task 12 rejected
// reusing that number for knownBlockCap because blocks-only traffic is far
// slower than the number implies (knownBlockCap's own doc comment: 288
