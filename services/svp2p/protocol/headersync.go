	//
	// THIS CHECK IS RE-RUN FOR EVERY PEER ON EVERY SYNC TICK, which is what
	// SendBlockSync gets for free: SendMessages calls it per peer
	// (net_processing.cpp:5865), so a peer that becomes eligible later still

	//
	// WHAT THE SWEEP PAYS OFF, because the cost was real while this check was
	// event-driven only. Past the final checkpoint headersFirstMode is false, so
	// CheckStall's header-progress refresh (blockdownload.go, the
	// IsHeadersFirstMode branch) is unreachable and nLastProgressTime moves only
	// when a block is delivered — to the ONE peer that delivered it
	// (BlockReceived). With MaxLastBlockTime at 180 seconds and mainnet blocks
	// about ten minutes apart, most 180 second windows deliver no block at all, so
	// every fSyncStarted peer rotates in the same pass. That freed every slot,
	// while the single election that followed returned on the FIRST peer to yield
	// messages and refilled exactly one; CheckStall's !fSyncStarted early return
	// then stopped a rotated-out peer from ever rotating again, so it triggered no
	// further election of its own. A node that reached several header peers fell to
	// exactly ONE within about 180 seconds and stayed there until peers
	// reconnected. The sweep restarts header sync with every eligible peer on the
	// next tick instead, and
	// TestSyncPass_HeaderSyncBreadthRecoversAfterEveryPeerRotates pins that.
	//
	// IT WAS NEVER A THREAT TO ALL-PEER DOWNLOAD SCHEDULING, and is not one now.
	// What that needs from a peer is pindexBestKnownBlock, and Task 4's promotion
	// mechanism supplies it from index growth alone, independently of fSyncStarted
	// — a peer that never held the sync slot is still schedulable. The collapse
	// cost header-sync breadth, not download breadth.
	//
	// THE !headersFirstMode CONJUNCT HAS NO SVNODE COUNTERPART. It is a
	// Teranode-specific structural guard, and SendBlockSync has nothing like
	// it, for the simple reason that SVNode has no headers-first round to
	// protect: the checkpointed round is legacy netsync's scheme, which this
	// port inherited from the legacy service and net_processing.cpp never had.
	// Phase 2 Task 5 scoped that round to ONE peer — only the slot holder may
	// index headers while it runs — so admitting a second fSyncStarted peer
	// mid-round would let it re-seed nextCheckpoint, headersFirstMode and
	// roundAnchorHeight underneath the peer driving the round.
	//
	// WHY IT EXISTS, and the dependency to re-evaluate it against. The plan for
	// this task argued the guard was unnecessary, because a round only runs
	// below the final checkpoint, where the tip is old. That argument conflates
	// HEIGHT with TIME and does not hold TODAY FOR ONE REASON: acceptHeader
	// deliberately does not port ContextualCheckBlockHeader's time-too-old rule
	// (validation.cpp:5904-5907 — see the note at that site, which books it as
	// a Phase 3 follow-up). With no median-time-past bound, a header at ANY
	// height may claim ANY timestamp up to the future cap, and Tip() answers
	// the highest-WORK node, which during a round is whatever the slot holder
	// served last. So a peer feeding a fresh node cheap headers below its first
	// checkpoint can make the tip look recent while the round still runs.
	//
	// IF THE TIME-TOO-OLD RULE EVER LANDS, re-evaluate this conjunct rather
	// than carrying it forward unexamined: a monotonic timestamp sequence would
	// restore the plan's argument, and the guard could then go. Do not remove
	// it before that, and do not remove it without first making
	// roundAnchorHeight per-peer — see the invariant note below.
	//
	// IT ALSO KEEPS THE ROUND STATE SINGLE-SOURCED. roundAnchorHeight and the
	// no-progress terminator that reads it (acceptHeaders) live on this
	// machine, not on the peer, and both are gated on headersFirstMode. Because
	// this conjunct makes "headersFirstMode is on" and "more than one peer holds
	// fSyncStarted" mutually exclusive, two simultaneous header sources can
	// never share that anchor and so can never make each other look
	// non-progressing. Outside a round, nextCheckpoint, headersFirstMode and
	// roundAnchorHeight are all inert — nothing reads them — so parallel header
	// syncs contend on nothing.
	//
	// The guard costs nothing in intended operation: past the final checkpoint,
	// where a tip within 24 hours of now actually occurs, headersFirstMode is

	// checkpoint the round is working toward. Its announcement still counts for
	// block availability, so it stays usable for download afterwards. Outside
	// the round every peer's headers are indexed, as net_processing.cpp does.
	//
	// An announcement-size ignored batch is unscored: junk headers cost a peer
	// nothing but our wire decode here, and SVNode's own HEADERS handler has
	// no solicitation check at all — accepting unsolicited announcements is
	// what makes block announcement work, so scoring them here would be
	// stricter than SVNode for the traffic pattern SVNode relies on.
	//
	// Task 11's policy: a BULK batch (len(headers) >= MaxBlocksToAnnounce) is
	// different. It cannot be an honest announcement — MAX_BLOCKS_TO_ANNOUNCE
	// is exactly the boundary net_processing.cpp itself uses to tell an
	// announcement from a bulk reply — so an unsolicited one is free to send
	// (a 37 byte inv earns a getheaders, and nothing here correlates a reply
	// to the request's HashStop, so one inv buys one free bulk decode of up
	// to MAX_HEADERS_RESULTS headers regardless of this policy). What this
	// scores is the batch that answers NEITHER an inv NOR any other
	// getheaders we sent — the peer that skips even that one-inv cost and
	// pushes bulk headers at us unprompted. scoreUnsolicitedBulkHeaders (see
	// its doc comment) scores that per occurrence, UNLESS the batch answers
	// a getheaders PeerManager actually sent this peer (solicited, above) —
	// which covers a bulk reply to BlockDownloader.OnInv's getHeadersFor, or
	// a peer that held the sync slot until moments ago and is still draining
	// its last continuation. The mechanism raises the cost of pure spam above
	// zero; it does not close the inv-first path, and closing that is beyond
	// this brief. THIS POLICY HAS NO SVNODE COUNTERPART; see the constant's
	// doc comment for the nearest relative, legacy netsync's mode-based
	// disconnect.
	//
	// The peer loop's equivalent gate for unrequested BLOCKS predates this:
	// those consume the shared admission budget and starve the sync peer,
	// where an unrequested headers batch costs only a decode and was already
	// bounded by MAX_HEADERS_RESULTS regardless of this policy.
	//
	// The cost of parking the announcement here — a peer stays unschedulable
	// until something resolves the hash — is what Phase 3 Task 4 answered, on
	// the OTHER side of the seam: PeerManager sweeps every peer's parked hash
	// through processBlockAvailability whenever the index grows, so this peer
	// becomes a download candidate the moment the round indexes what it
	// announced, with no further traffic from it.
	//
	// Soliciting getheaders from non-sync peers DURING a round was considered
	// for Task 4 and DECLINED (ledger M7), for two reasons. It has no SVNode
	// source: net_processing.cpp starts header sync only from SendBlockSync. And
	// mid-round solicitation would put headers from unsolicited peers back on the
	// round this gate exists to protect.
	//
	// SendBlockSync's own near-tip relaxation is NOT a third reason, though it
	// reads like one. This port refuses that relaxation while a round runs (the

// never adopt.
//
// The source's first half — Checkpoints::CheckBlock, the hash-must-match rule
// at a checkpoint height — is not repeated here. This port already carries it
// in acceptHeaders, from legacy netsync manager.go, where it is scoped to the
// headers-first round and answers with ErrCheckpointMismatch. Running it twice
// would give one rule two different refusal shapes.
//
// WHAT THAT COSTS. The two rules cover different sets, and the omission leaves

// highest checkpoint currently in the index — one the sync has not reached yet:
//
//   - this fence does not refuse a wrong-hash header there, because the header's
//     height is above the fence height, which is all this rule tests;
//   - the round's check does not see it either, unless the header arrives from
//     the peer holding the sync slot while headers-first mode is running.
//
// So a NON-SYNC peer's header claiming a wrong hash at an unreached checkpoint
// height is checked by neither rule, and is indexed if it satisfies the
// difficulty and timestamp gates. It cannot mislead the sync round, which
// re-checks the checkpoint when it gets there, and it cannot take the tip
// without out-working the honest chain. It does cost an index entry. Closing it
// means porting CheckBlock here and accepting two refusal shapes for one rule,
// or unifying both onto this one — a deliberate design change, not an edit.
//
// It runs for every new header, in a round or outside one, which is what
// bounds HeaderIndex growth below the final checkpoint: a peer cannot spend a
// map entry on a header at a height our chain has already settled.
//
// The source resolves the fence itself with Checkpoints::GetLastCheckpoint;
// here the caller resolves it through lastCheckpointInIndex and passes it in,
// so the rule stays a pure function of the two values it compares and the
