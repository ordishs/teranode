// The bound is on message COUNT, not bytes (review round 1, Important 3):
// each of the 100 slots retains a whole *wire.MsgTx, decoded, not a fixed-

// currently allows one MsgTx to declare: MsgTx.MaxPayloadLength returns
// MaxBlockPayload() (go-wire msg_tx.go), i.e. a tx has NO size limit of its
// own distinct from a block's. That ceiling tracks the excessive-block-size
// value passed to wire.SetLimits, which for every node running this
// package is 4,000,000,000 (Server.Init, unconditional) — NOT go-wire's
// own pre-SetLimits default of 32,000,000 (giving a 64 MiB maxMessagePayload
// pre-check and a ~30.5 MiB per-tx mpl at that default; neither is the
// figure that applies here). So the true worst case for THIS node is
// ~3.73 GiB (4,000,000,000 bytes) per queued entry, and
// ~373 GiB (100 * 3.73 GiB) per peer at this bound — a ceiling that
// predates this task (it governs every non-block message type, not
// something Task 14 introduced) but whose blast radius this queue widens:
// before, one such tx was decoded, validated-or-rejected, and released by a
// single synchronous call; now up to 100 can be retained per peer at once.

// bound this far below the theoretical figure, and the transport's own

//     returned here, so the classification stays with the scheduler.
//   - The idle timeout, when no running ingest excuses it (see ingestAlive).
//   - StallActionDisconnect or StallActionDisconnectTimeout, the two
//     net_processing.cpp DetectStalling rules, decided by the manager's stall
//     ticker (blockdownload.go CheckStall). Either arrives as Disconnect from
//     outside this loop, not as a returned error, carrying the rule's own
//     reason text (StallAction.DisconnectReason).
//   - The ban threshold, reached by the handshake's own scoring or by a
//     misbehavior delta a sync machine returned (checkBanThreshold).
//   - HeaderSync's two round-ending errors, ErrCheckpointMismatch and
//     ErrHeadersNoProgress, returned through syncDispatcher.Headers. The machine

// round 1, Important 3) rather than silently ported as a smaller version of
// it. Legacy's OnTx does the opposite on purpose, and says so:
// "intentionally block further receives until the transaction is fully
// processed and known good or bad. This helps prevent a malicious peer from
// queuing up a bunch of bad transactions before disconnecting (or being
// disconnected) and wasting memory" (OnTx, services/legacy/peer_server.go:
// 910-914, the QueueTx call itself at :915 — verified directly against the
// file, not against a prior citation of this same quote, which was wrong
// twice over: this port's own review round 1 fix cited :900-905, and it
// propagated from a citation in the controller's own round-1 text; the
// blocking send QueueTx makes is manager.go:2668, sm.msgChan<- into the
// single global 10,000-deep queue). Legacy can afford to block there
// because OnTx runs on that peer's own dedicated callback goroutine,
// separate from the one that services pings — blocking it stalls only that
// peer's further reads. This package has no such separation: queueTx runs
// on dispatchTx <- handleMessage <- Run's own select loop, the SAME
// goroutine that also owns the idle timer, pings and shutdown (exactly why
// block ingestion was moved off it — startIngest's own doc comment). A
// blocking send here would stall Run itself, not just this peer's tx
// processing, reintroducing the defect Task 10 already fixed for blocks.
// So: dropped, not blocked. The consequence, honestly stated: a dropped
// unsolicited tx has no ack and no retry, so it is genuinely LOST for this
// delivery attempt, not merely delayed the way legacy's blocking peer would
// be — and it does not self-heal until Task 16 wires the inv->getdata round
// trip, at which point another peer's inv of the same hash can still recover
// it. Unsolicited transactions are never punished either way (F3), so a
// drop here stays a capacity decision, not a fault judgement.
//
// Logged at Warn, not Debug (review round 1, Important 3/Minor 5): a silent
// Debug-level drop of peer data is invisible in a normal production
// deployment, and this file's own convention already logs every other drop
// at Warn (see Peer.send). hash is dispatchTx's caller-computed
// msg.TxHash(), passed in rather than recomputed here — a stale version of
// this comment claimed the hash was "deliberately NOT computed" to avoid a
// double-SHA256 on the drop path, which stopped being true the moment
// dispatchTx started computing it unconditionally for MarkTxKnown (review
// round 1, Important 2): the cost moved, it was never removed, and legacy

// (peer_server.go:895, msg.TxHash(), a Go function argument evaluated
// whether or not debug logging is enabled) and then hashes again three
// lines later (:907, tx.Hash() — a fresh bsvutil.Tx, so nothing is cached
// from the first hash to reuse). Reusing dispatchTx's already-paid-for

// runs now is OUR post-stream pipeline tail — extendTransactions, createUtxos,
// createSubtrees, ProcessBlock — which outlasts the idle window on a fat
// block. Judging that tail on byte silence disconnects the peer mid-validation,
// and Run's deferred cancel then aborts the ingest, so the block comes back
// and stalls exactly the same way for ever. The tail is bounded by
// MaxBlockDownloadTime instead: the same ceiling CheckStall puts on one block's
// hold over the sync slot, so an ingest wedged for good still ends the peer.
//
// No byte has moved yet. bridge.ProgressReader's contract, stated on the type:
// LastProgress is seeded at construction, and BytesRead stays at 0 through
// IngestBlock's LOCAL pre-read waits (WaitForBlockAssemblyReady,
// waitForPreviousBlockMined). A peer must never be dropped for our own
