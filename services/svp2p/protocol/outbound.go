// This file is net.cpp CConnman::ThreadOpenConnections (net.cpp:1816) reduced
// to the part svp2p needs: the addrman-fed outbound connection loop. The
// retry/backoff machinery for a NAMED peer already exists in
// PeerManager.dialLoop (legacy_connect_peers), and SVNode keeps those two
// apart the same way — ThreadOpenConnections' `-connect` branch
// (net.cpp:1817-1836) returns without ever reaching the loop below, which is
// why legacy_connect_peers stays dominant when it is set.
//
// DNS seeds are deliberately NOT here (SVNode's ThreadDNSAddressSeed,
// net.cpp:1622): out of scope for this task. Neither is the fixed-seed
// fallback the loop reaches when the table is empty (net.cpp:1842-1855), nor
// feeler connections (net.cpp:1897-1918), nor one-shots (ProcessOneShot,
// net.cpp:1801), nor addnode slots (net.cpp:2050-2090). Each is listed in the
// task's residual ledger rather than half-built.
//
// LOCKING (the package contract, restated because this file adds a caller of
// it): all sync-state machines are caller-locked under PeerManager.syncMu, the
// lock order is peer lock then manager lock, and NO blocking call may run
// under syncMu. A dial blocks, so it never runs under syncMu or mu: the loop
// snapshots the registry under mu, releases it, reads the address table
// (AddrMan is self-synchronising and outside the sync-state graph), and hands
// the dial itself to a fresh goroutine.
