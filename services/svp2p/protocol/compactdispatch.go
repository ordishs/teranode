//
// THE ABOVE-THE-CEILING FALLBACKS (:3902-3923). A block more than
// MaxCompactBlockHeightAhead above our tip takes one of two branches in
// SVNode, and this port reaches the same end state through machinery it
// already has rather than by porting either branch literally:
//
//   - :3904-3911, the block is already in flight: push a getdata for it. Here
//     the scheduler owns getdata and re-offers the block on its own tick
//     (BlockDownloader.SendGetDataBlocks), so the same request goes out one
//     TickInterval later.
//   - :3913-3921, otherwise: "we want the same treatment as a header message"
//     and the announcement is reprocessed as a plain headers message. This
//     port's header accept below runs UNCONDITIONALLY, ahead of every guard,
//     so the header is already in the index and updateBlockAvailability has
//     already run by the time the ceiling refuses the block — which is the
//     whole of what that branch achieves.
//
// WHAT IS NOT PORTED. The optimistic reconstruction at :3883-3900, for a block
// already in flight from ANOTHER peer, needs a second partial block per hash
// and buys only a saved round trip.
