// Serving answers the two chain-query messages from the header index: the
// net_processing.cpp ProcessGetHeadersMessage (:2968) and ProcessGetBlocks
// (:2551) handlers. Like the other machines in this package it performs no
// I/O: each method reads the index and returns the messages the caller must
// send (spec §4.3).
//
// Both machines serve the ACTIVE chain — the tip the blockchain service has
// validated, handed in by the caller — and never the header index tip, which
// headers-first sync runs ahead to. Serving headers for blocks we cannot
// serve the bodies of would invite getdata we can only answer with notfound.
//
// Locking: Serving carries no lock of its own. Like HeaderSync and
// BlockDownloader, every method assumes the caller already holds
// PeerManager's shared sync-state mutex — this package's port of cs_main.
//
// Four guards ProcessGetHeadersMessage and ProcessGetBlocks carry are NOT
// ported here, each for a stated reason:
//
//   - The pendingResponses limit (net_processing.cpp:2974-2988), which
//     disconnects a non-whitelisted peer with too many getheaders replies
//     still queued. It measures the depth of the send queue per request type,
//     which this port's transport does not expose; it is a flood guard worth
//     having, and is carried as a Phase 3 hardening residual rather than
//     silently dropped.
//   - The AreOlderOrEqualUnvalidatedBlockIndexCandidates deferral
//     (net_processing.cpp:2564-2567), which parks a getblocks reply while a
//     block received before the request is still an unvalidated candidate. It
//     exists for the compact-block announcement race, and this port announces
//     no compact blocks (Phase 4).
//   - The pruning branch (net_processing.cpp:2593-2604). Teranode does not
//     prune blocks the way fPruneMode does, and it has no counterpart of
//     nPrunedBlocksLikelyToHave.
//   - state->pindexBestHeaderSent (net_processing.cpp:3040-3045), which
//     SendMessages reads when it decides whether to announce a new block by
//     headers. That consumer arrives with the relay path (Task 12), and
//     peerSyncState deliberately carries no field without a consumer, so the
//     field is added there, not here.

// refused reports the catch-up refusal, and is the ONE case that answers
// nothing at all rather than a possibly empty headers message. The rule is
// carried verbatim from the legacy service (services/legacy/peer_server.go:1574-1589):
// "Don't serve headers to other peers while we're actively syncing in

// competes with our own header processing and costs the sync its
// three-minute window. SVNode refuses on IsInitialBlockDownload() instead
// (net_processing.cpp:2995-3000) — the same intent measured against the state
// this port does not carry — and exempts whitelisted peers, which this port
// has no notion of. The caller logs the refusal: the machines hold no logger.
//
// An empty locator is not a peer error. SVNode reads that case as "the peer
// named its start with hashStop" (GetFirstBlockIndexFromLocatorNL,

// most blocking thing this service does — it must never run under the
// sync-state mutex this package's machines are called under (see the note on
// Serving).
//
// Classification is a pure function of inv.Type, so doing it here, once, on
// arrival is equivalent to the C++ doing it per entry at serve time.
//
// # What the caller must do with the result, and why it is not one flat loop
//
// ProcessGetData is PACED. Two mechanisms, both load-bearing, and the caller
// (peer.go servePass) implements both:
//
//   - At most ONE block-type entry per pass. After any entry whose type
//     IsBlockType (protocol.h:577), served or not, the C++ breaks out of its
//     while loop unconditionally (net_processing.cpp:1448-1452). Transactions
//     keep looping; the first block ends the pass. Use getDataKind.blockType.
//   - The unserved remainder is RETAINED. pfrom->vRecvGetData is a persistent
//     deque, and :1456 erases only the prefix actually consumed. Without this
//     a peer could getdata MaxInvPerMsg block hashes in one message and hold
//     us for hours, at two asset reads per block.
//
// The one pacing guard NOT ported is the GetPausedForSending break
// (net_processing.cpp:1176-1179), which stops a pass when the send buffer is
// already too full to answer. It needs the send-queue depth, which this port's
// transport does not expose — the same accessor the getheaders flood limit
// wants, and the same Phase 3 hardening residual.
//
// # notfound answers an unserved transaction AND an unserved block
//
// This is a DELIBERATE DIVERGENCE from SVNode, priced below.
//
// SVNode notfounds transactions only. vNotFound.push_back appears exactly
// twice in ProcessGetData: :1418 for MSG_TX when nothing was pushed, and :1442
// for MSG_DATAREF_TX when the dataref index had no entry. The block branch
// pushes it on NONE of its not-sent paths — unknown block, an old off-chain
// block (:1233-1237), the historical-serving limit (:1245-1257), or a block the
// store cannot stream. The C++ comment at :1458-1466 says why: notfound exists
// for SPV clients recursively walking the dependencies of unconfirmed
// transactions, so it was never meant as a block-serving mechanism.
//
// This port answers the block too, taking legacy's shape instead
// (services/legacy/peer_server.go:1491-1493, which notfounds every entry it
// could not push). Three reasons, in ascending order of weight:
//
//   - Precedent. Task 8 already ruled this exact shape the same way for
//     getheaders (Phase 3 execution ledger, Decision 5): silence is
//     indistinguishable from a dropped message.
//   - Legacy's behaviour is field-proven on this network. SVNode's
//     silence-for-blocks is proven for SVNode, which is not the same claim.
//   - What actually prices the trade: this port has an unconditional per-block
//     download timeout (blockdownload.go BlockDownloadTimeoutBase, 100 seconds,
//     600 during IBD). A peer we answer with silence therefore pays a full
//     timeout window before it re-requests the block elsewhere, while a peer we
//     answer with notfound can release its in-flight assignment at once. We
//     want our own peers to tell us; telling them is the symmetric choice.
//
// This port has no inbound notfound handler, and that is PARITY, not a gap:
// SVNode ignores an inbound notfound outright, with the explicit comment "We do
// not care about the NOTFOUND message, but logging an Unknown Command message
// would be undesirable as we transmit it ourselves"
// (net_processing.cpp:4847-4850), and the legacy service only logs one
// (OnNotFound, services/legacy/peer_server.go:1836-1843). Neither releases an
// in-flight assignment on it. Here an inbound notfound falls through
// dispatchSync's switch, which has no default, so it is ignored without a
// misbehavior score or a disconnect — the same outcome by a different route.
//
// So the reasoning above is asymmetric on purpose: we tell peers more than
// either reference tells us. CONSUMING a peer's notfound to release an
// assignment early would be a deliberate improvement over both, and is worth
// having precisely because the per-block timeouts are unconditional; it is
// booked as such rather than left implied here.
//
// The >4 GiB refusal is answered the same way and for a further reason of its
// own (OPEN QUESTION 5) — see serveBlock. What is NOT answered is anything
// below.
//
// # The three kinds we cannot answer, and why none drops the peer
//
// A filtered block, an inv type we do not implement, and a nil entry are all
// answered with a warn log and nothing else.
//
// Neither reference disconnects and neither replies. ProcessGetData has no
// else-clause: an unhandled type falls straight through to
// GetMainSignals().Inventory and the next iteration. Legacy logs "Unknown type
// in inventory request %d" and continues (peer_server.go:1471-1475). For a
// filtered block specifically, legacy's pushMerkleBlockMsg returns early and
// silently when the peer has no filter loaded.
//
// The "Got invalid inv type" -> fDisconnect rule is in the INV handler only
// (blockdownload.go OnInv), and the asymmetry is the point: an inv ASSERTS the
// peer holds data, so a bogus type there is misbehaviour, while a getdata only
// REQUESTS it, so an unimplemented type is a gap on our side. Nor may these
// answer notfound: notfound asserts "I do not have that item", and for a type
// we never parsed we cannot honestly name an item. A peer asking for a type we
// do not implement waits out its own request timeout, exactly as it would
// against SVNode.
//
// A nil entry cannot come off the wire but must not panic an in-process
// caller, the same rule as derefHashes.
//
// # Two ProcessGetData guards NOT ported, each for a stated reason
//
//   - The fingerprinting guard on off-chain blocks (:1215-1231), which serves a
//     block outside the active chain only if it is fully valid and less than a
//     month old in both time and equivalent work. It reads
//     BlockValidity::SCRIPTS and GetBlockProofEquivalentTime, neither of which
//     this port carries, and the deferral branch above it (:1194-1213) exists
//     for the same candidate machinery. Carried as a Phase 3 hardening
//     residual.
//   - The historical-block outbound limit (:1240-1256), which disconnects a
//     non-whitelisted peer once OutboundTargetReached. This port tracks no
//     outbound byte target and has no whitelist.
//
// One legacy guard is also not ported: the decaying ban score for oversized
// inventory queries (peer_server.go:1436-1442, `uint32(length)*99/wire.MaxInvPerMsg`).
// This package's misbehavior counter does not decay, so porting the number
// without the decay would ban a peer performing IBD — the exact case legacy's
// comment says the decay exists to protect. Carried as a residual, and note
// go-wire already caps an inbound getdata at MaxInvPerMsg entries.
