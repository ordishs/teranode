	// (net/block_download_tracker.cpp:113-127) scores the DoS level the
	// validation state carries — Misbehaving(node, nDoS,
	// state.GetRejectReason()) — and every block-invalidity site in SVNode's
	// validation.cpp sets that level to 100: state.DoS(100, ...) at :537
	// (bad-txns-oversize), :579 (bad-cb-missing), :589 (bad-cb-length), :3714
	// (blk-bad-inputs), and so on throughout CheckBlock and ConnectBlock.
	//
	// 100 equals banScoreThreshold, so one invalid block reaches the threshold
	// on its own. That is SVNode's own arithmetic, and it is why the reject
	// disconnects immediately as well as scoring: the score is what survives
	// the reconnect.
	//
	// SVNode gates that Misbehaving call TWICE, and this port satisfies both
	// gates rather than skipping them.
	//
	// The first gate is the reject-code window at block_download_tracker.cpp
	// :117 — see isPeerAttributableReject (services/svp2p/ingest.go), which is
	// this port's analogue of it and carries the citation.
	//
	// The second is the per-block `punish` flag at :124 (`nDoS > 0 &&
	// it->second.punish`), recorded by MarkBlockAsReceived(blockSource, punish,
	// state) at :68-73 and declared at block_download_tracker.h:97-101. Its
	// three call sites split, and the split is entirely about BIP 152:
	//
	//   - punish=TRUE at net_processing.cpp:4058, in ProcessBlockMessage
	//     (:4027) — the ordinary solicited `block` message path.
	//   - punish=FALSE at net_processing.cpp:3683, in ProcessBlockTxnMessage
	//     (:3613), whose own comment gives the reason: "BIP 152 permits peers
	//     to relay compact blocks after validating the header only; we should
	//     not punish peers if the block turns out to be invalid."
	//   - punish=FALSE at net_processing.cpp:3984, in
	//     ProcessCompactBlockMessage (:3731), the fBlockReconstructed branch —
	//     a compact block optimistically reconstructed while it is in flight
	//     from a different peer.
	//
	// Both false sites are compact-block paths, and compact blocks are out of
	// scope for this phase (spec §10 item 5). This port has no BLOCKTXN and no
	// cmpctblock path at all, so ProcessBlockMessage is the only analogue any
	// svp2p ingest entry has, every reachable case is punish=true, and scoring
	// every PeerFault unconditionally is faithful rather than approximate.
	//
	// FORWARD TRIGGER: whoever adds compact blocks MUST add the punish flag in
	// the same change. Without it this port will ban peers for compact blocks

		// The regtest branch refuses far less: it reads the address alone, and
		// nothing whatsoever once AllowSyncCandidateFromLocalPeers is set. So
		// without this, a peer could take the sync slot — and be sent a
		// getheaders — before its verack. It is also what peer.go dispatchSync

		// and SendGetDataBlocks at :5888. The eligibility sweep therefore comes
		// FIRST, ahead of both the stall check and the getdata pass for the same
		// peer.
		//
		// That order is what makes the rotate branch below hold without a second
		// exclusion rule: a peer that rotates on this pass had its sweep before
		// the rotation, and nothing sweeps it again, so it cannot take the slot
		// back on the pass that took it away.
		//
		// The sweep is the per-pass half of net_processing.cpp SendBlockSync
		// (net_processing.cpp:5180-5222). PeerEstablished was previously reached
		// only from PeerManager.Established (the handshake) and from electLocked
		// (a rotation or a peerGone), so a peer that became eligible later never
		// started header sync — see the note at PeerEstablished for what that
		// cost past the final checkpoint. Its per-tick cost is one bool read for a
		// peer that already holds the slot; for any other peer one
		// isSyncCandidate, plus — while somebody else holds the slot outside a
		// headers-first round — one header-index tip read, one lookup and one
		// clock read, which is the near-tip test.
		//
		// WHAT THE SWEEP COSTS IN STEADY STATE, past the final checkpoint, because
		// it is not free and it is a divergence from SVNode. The 24 hour near-tip
		// relaxation admits every eligible peer there, headersFirstMode is off so
		// CheckStall's header-progress refresh is unreachable, and
		// nLastProgressTime moves only on a delivered block. Mainnet blocks are
		// about ten minutes apart against a 180 second rotation window, so most
		// windows deliver nothing and EVERY header peer rotates, then the next
		// tick's sweep re-admits all of them — for ever. Each cycle costs one
		// getheaders per peer, one clearPeer per peer, which nils
		// pindexLastCommonBlock and so buys a fresh lastCommonAncestor walk on the
		// next download pass, and one resetHeaderState. SVNode pays none of it: it
		// has no sync-peer rotation at all, and keeps a sync peer until it
		// disconnects or its blocks time out. The rotation is the licensed legacy
		// netsync deviation documented at CheckStall; the churn is what it costs
		// once every eligible peer is swept rather than one being elected.
		//
		// Nothing here blocks, which is what lets it run under syncMu: any
		// getheaders it produces joins out and is sent by syncTickOnce after the
		// unlock, the collect-then-act shape this file keeps throughout.

			// what releases the slot and the peer's downloads. CheckStall itself
			// mutated nothing on this branch.
			//
			// THE SWEEP ABOVE MAY HAVE, THOUGH, and this is the hazard the source
			// pass order carries. A peer holding no slot but heading the download
			// window is granted the slot by the sweep and disconnected by this
			// clause on the SAME pass, so as the first sync peer it has just
			// seeded fSyncStarted, nSyncStarted, nextCheckpoint, headersFirstMode
			// and roundAnchorHeight — for a peer that is about to go. While it
			// holds that slot every peer after it on this pass is refused, because
			// PeerEstablished's single-slot guard reads the mode as it stands.
			//
			// The order is not ours to change: SVNode runs SendBlockSync (:5865)
			// before DetectStalling (:5881) and carries the same hazard.
			//
			// WHAT MAKES IT SAFE IS THE UNWIND, and the whole of it runs:
			// Peer.Disconnect closes the connection, so Peer.Run returns and
			// runPeer reaches peerGone unconditionally. peerGone calls
			// BlockDownloader.PeerDisconnected, which releases the peer's
			// downloads, and HeaderSync.PeerDisconnected, which reaches
			// releaseSyncPeer. That clears fSyncStarted, decrements nSyncStarted
			// and runs resetHeaderState, which clears headersFirstMode and
			// roundAnchorHeight and re-seeds nextCheckpoint from the current tip.
			// releaseSyncPeer's own !fSyncStarted early return cannot fire here:
			// the sweep has just set the flag and nothing between clears it.
			// TestSyncPass_ADisconnectUnwindsTheSlotTheSweepJustGranted walks that
			// path and asserts each piece.
			//
			// Whatever the sweep produced for this peer is dropped with it.
			// syncTickOnce disconnects before it sends, so the message would
			// reach a closed peer; C++ has already pushed its getheaders by this
			// point, but there PushMessage precedes the fDisconnect flag. It is
			// the same reasoning OnInv states for its own error path: messages
			// queued for a peer we are about to drop are not worth sending.
			// Both clauses land here because the ACTION the caller must take is
			// identical; only the reason differs, and it rides along so the log
			// and the peer's own disconnect reason can name the rule that fired.

			// on THIS pass: clearPeer nils pindexLastCommonBlock but keeps
			// pindexBestKnownBlock, so FindNextBlocksToDownload bootstraps the
			// window from our own tip again and refills it.
			//
			// The seam is a composition of two models, and neither model's
			// safety net came across with it. SVNode runs a per-peer download
			// loop and relies on a per-block download timeout to take blocks
			// back from a peer that does not deliver. legacy netsync rotates
			// the sync peer alone and hands blocks to nobody else. Composed
			// here, the rotated peer keeps being re-handed blocks, while its
			// own rotation clause can no longer fire for it, because
			// SyncPeerTimedOut cleared fSyncStarted. What DOES still govern it
			// from here is stated at CheckStall.
			//
			// The skip costs this peer its own chance to NAME a staller on
			// this pass, since that clock is started from inside
			// SendGetDataBlocks. Every other peer on the pass still names one,
			// and the next tick gives this peer the chance back.
			//
			// THE SWEEP ABOVE CANNOT HAVE PRODUCED ANYTHING FOR THIS PEER, and
			// that coupling is what makes "the rotating peer is asked for nothing"
			// hold rather than the weaker "asked for no blocks". The rotation
			// clause only ever judges a peer with fSyncStarted set — CheckStall's
			// !fSyncStarted early return sits above it — and PeerEstablished
			// returns nil for exactly that peer. So msgs is empty here, and the
			// send list below gets no entry for this peer. Anything that ever
			// lets PeerEstablished answer an fSyncStarted peer breaks that, and
			// TestSyncPass_ASingleCandidateNodeTakesTheSlotBackOnTheNextTick is
			// what would catch it.
