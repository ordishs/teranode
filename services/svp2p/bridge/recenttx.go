// PartiallyDownloadedBlock::InitData (bitcoin-sv
// src/blockencodings.cpp:171-199): Teranode has no mempool, so bridge keeps a
// bounded ring of the transaction hashes it has seen recently, oldest
// evicted first, and reads the bytes from the store only when a block
// actually needs them.
//
// Two sites feed it: the txmeta topic's ADD entries (kafka.go
// handleTxMetaMessage), which are the closest thing this node has to
// "entered the mempool", and the orphan pool (orphans.go add), which stands
// in for SVNode's separate vExtraTxnForCompact buffer (net_processing.cpp;
// blockencodings.cpp:194-215 reads it right after the mempool walk).
//

// manager's syncMu: Match hashes the whole ring and Open reads the store, so
// both are long calls by the manager's standards.

// (a 160 MiB ring plus a ~344 MiB map), measured by
