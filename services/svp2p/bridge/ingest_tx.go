// maximum number of rejected transactions ... to prevent memory exhaustion").
// Per-instance cost: at most 10,000 chainhash.Hash keys (32 bytes each) plus
// map overhead, well under 1 MiB. Aggregate cost across a running node is
// this single figure, not multiplied by peer count: rejectedTxns is owned
// once by the bridge (mirroring legacy's own single SyncManager-wide set),
// never per-peer — unlike the pending-inv deque (Task 10) and knownBlocks
// (Task 12), which are genuinely per-connection state.

// their zero value is the "already rejected, silently ignored" outcome
// (legacy's own unsolicited-and-previously-rejected short-circuit,
// netsync/manager.go:1218-1224): nothing further happens for it.

	// Orphan reports a missing-parent/locked classification
	// (errors.ErrTxMissingParent or errors.ErrTxLocked). The transaction is
	// added to the orphan pool (orphans.go) before this returns; a reject
	// is "we refuse this", an orphan is "we cannot judge this yet" — the
	// two sets stay distinct (see svp2pBridge.orphanPool's own doc
	// comment).

	// ReleasedOrphans lists orphans the release walk promoted to accepted
	// as a side effect of THIS tx's acceptance (orphans.go's release,
	// legacy's own processOrphanTransactions, netsync/manager.go:1309).
	// Populated only when Accepted; nil on every other outcome. The
	// caller feeds each one to the same announce seam it feeds TxHash/Fee/
	// Size for the primary accepted tx (services/svp2p/ingest.go).

	// Reject is the wire.MsgReject to send to the peer, when the

	// every other outcome, including the "already rejected" short-circuit,
	// which legacy deliberately does NOT re-reject (see the type doc above).

// IngestTx runs one inbound transaction through the relocated netsync
// handleTxMsg core (services/legacy/netsync/manager.go:1194-1310, no SVNode
// counterpart — this task is a fidelity relocation, not a reimplementation).
// txBytes is the transaction's wire-serialized bytes; peerAddr identifies
// the sending peer for logging only.
//
// Classification, in order:
//  1. Already rejected (rejectedTxns.Get) — ignored silently, no validator
//     call, no reject message (manager.go:1218-1224: BitcoinJ interop means
//     legacy never disconnects or scores an unsolicited peer for this, and
//     it does not re-reject a tx it already told the network was invalid).
//  2. errors.ErrTxMissingParent / errors.ErrTxLocked — orphan. Task 15's
//     pool is the next step; this method classifies and stops
//     (manager.go:1256-1273).
//  3. Any other validation error — rejected: recorded in rejectedTxns (not
//     requested again "until a new block has been processed",
//     manager.go:1276-1282) and returned as a wire.MsgReject for the caller
//     to send (manager.go PushRejectMsg, relocated as data rather than a
//     socket write per the bridge I/O-free contract). One omission,
//     disclosed rather than silent (review round 1, Minor 2): legacy's
//     PushRejectMsg suppresses the reject entirely when the peer's
//     negotiated protocol version is below wire.RejectVersion
//     (services/legacy/peer/peer.go:1135-1137). This method has no peer
//     handle to check that against — the caller would have to withhold the
//     Reject it gets back instead — and is not carried here. Irrelevant in
//     practice against any modern peer, RejectVersion having shipped in
//     Bitcoin protocol version 70002.
//  4. Success — accepted; Fee/Size are populated for the tx announcement
//     relay (manager.go:1295-1305, acceptedTxs / AnnounceNewTransactions).
//
// block height 0 is passed to Validate, which defaults to the UTXO store's
// own block height (the same comment legacy carries verbatim at
// manager.go:1242).
