// 256 is sized against the default cap, not independent of it: at

// 256 has headroom for that whole burst plus a concurrent cap eviction or
// two without dropping anything — at the default cap, no attempt is ever
// dropped. It is fixed rather than scaled to legacy_maxOrphanTxs because a
// dropped final-validation attempt is an accepted best-effort loss either
// way (onEvict's own doc comment); this size is chosen so the default
// configuration never pays that cost, not to guarantee zero drops at every
// possible cap setting. See orphanPool's own doc comment for what this
// means for the disabled-cap case, where the queue is a net improvement
// over fix round 1's own starting point, not merely a new bound.

// orphanPool is the relocated netsync orphan pool (spec §6, "SVNode
// semantics with the existing eviction settings"). SVNode's own COrphanTxns
// (src/orphan_txns.h in the reference checkout) keeps both a flat,
// hash-keyed map (mOrphanTxns, :128) and a secondary index by the parent
// outpoints an orphan waits on (mOrphanTxnsByPrev, :129) — so the real
// structural difference from this port is that secondary index, not the
// presence or absence of a flat map. This port keeps legacy's own
// expiringmap + orphanTxAndParents shape instead (single flat map, no
// secondary index — services/legacy/netsync/manager.go:277, :458, :3165),
// because that is the hardened, in-production behaviour this plan relocates
// (spec §1: "keeps the hardened Teranode-side ingestion pipeline"), not a
// fresh implementation against the C++ reference.
//
// Sizing and TTL come from the two settings G1 confirms are already wired:
// legacy_maxOrphanTxs (default 100, settings/legacy_settings.go:14) and
// legacy_orphanEvictionDuration (default 10m, :13), both read in
// settings/settings.go:662-663. Per-instance cost at the default cap is NOT
// just the resident pool: it is the resident entries (at most 100) PLUS
// whatever fix round 1's eviction-hand-off queue is holding (at most
// orphanEvictionQueueSize, 256 — see that const's own doc comment for why
// 256 against a cap of 100), because a queued entry is a full decoded
// transaction the pool has already evicted but not yet finally validated.
// Worst case at the default cap is therefore 100 + 256 = 356 resident
// transactions, each with a hash-keyed parent set sized to its input
// count — still in the low hundreds of KB to low single-digit MB total for
// ordinary transactions, not the "100 entries" the cap alone would suggest.
// legacy_maxOrphanTxs = 0 disables the cap (expiringmap.WithMaxSize's own
// "a value of 0 ... disables the cap" contract,
// util/expiringmap/expiringmap.go): the operator has explicitly asked for
// legacy's original unbounded behaviour, "not recommended on public
// networks" (the setting's own longdesc). Disabling the cap removes two
// independent bounds, not one: the memory bound the longdesc names
// directly, and the stack-depth bound release's own doc comment below
// covers — and release's per-pop Items() call (a full map copy,
// expiringmap.go's own Items) makes the walk's cost O(n^2) in the pool's
// size, so a disabled cap also turns that quadratic term peer-controlled.
// Legacy shares the identical O(n^2) shape (processOrphanTransactions'
// own Items() snapshot per recursive call), so this is fidelity-preserving,
// not a regression this port introduced — it is named here because the
// disabled-cap configuration is where it stops being negligible. One thing
// the disabled cap does NOT make worse, because of fix round 1's own I1
// fix: a TTL sweep at legacy_maxOrphanTxs = 0 now hands off at most
// orphanEvictionQueueSize (256) expired entries to the worker and drops
// the rest (counted, not silent — see onEvict), rather than validating
// every expired entry serially under expiringmap's write lock the way this
// port did before I1. The disabled cap still costs memory and quadratic
// time unboundedly; it no longer also costs an unbounded whole-node
// tx-ingest stall during a TTL sweep.
//
// Owned once per bridge instance, not per peer (mirroring legacy's own
// single SyncManager-wide sm.orphanTxs): the aggregate cost across a
// running node is this single pool's cost, not multiplied by peer count.
//
// Two background goroutines are owned by one pool instance: expiringmap's
// own TTL ticker (started inside expiringmap.New, stopped by stop() below
// calling p.m.Stop()) and this pool's eviction-validation worker
// (runEvictionWorker, started here, stopped by the same stop() cancelling

// network round trip made while expiringmap holds its own internal write
// mutex (evictOldestLocked, the cap path called from Set; clean(), the TTL
// path called from expiringmap's own background ticker) — and release
// takes that same write lock on every accepted tx, so the block was on the
// whole node's tx-ingest path, not merely on orphan handling. A TTL sweep
// that evicts many entries in one pass validated every one of them
// serially under that lock, which could stall all peers' tx ingestion for
// the sweep's full duration. It also violated expiringmap's own stated
// invariant that eviction never blocks under its mutex
// (expiringmap.go:87-89, about its eviction-channel send — a blocking
// validate in evictionFn broke that guarantee for this consumer just the
// same).

// Now onEvict only hands the evicted entry to runEvictionWorker

// itself happens on that worker's own goroutine, entirely outside

// becomes best-effort rather than guaranteed — a full evictions buffer
// drops the attempt rather than blocking the evicting caller — which is
// acceptable because legacy_maxOrphanTxs's own longdesc already frames the
// final attempt as a courtesy ("mirroring TTL-based eviction semantics"),
// not as a correctness requirement anything downstream depends on. Drops
// are counted in p.dropped rather than silent.

// re-enters this pool (add, release, Get, ...) on the calling goroutine —

//
// G3 finding: legacy recurses once per newly-accepted orphan, and the only

// legacy_maxOrphanTxs, 100 by default — because each recursive call scans
// the whole pool (sm.orphanTxs.Items()) for children of the tx it was just

// currently sitting in the pool. That makes the cap load-bearing for stack
// safety, not merely for memory — worth stating at both sites, so it is
// stated here and on orphanPool's own doc comment above. When
// legacy_maxOrphanTxs is 0 (G2's disabled-cap case) that bound disappears
// entirely: a peer can chain as many orphans as memory allows and then
// submit the root, and legacy's own recursion depth would track the full
// chain length with no cap at all. Porting that recursion verbatim would
// reintroduce a peer-controlled, unbounded call-stack depth on top of the
// memory-exhaustion and quadratic-time risks the disabled cap already
// carries (see orphanPool's own doc comment) — a THIRD, silent hazard the
// operator did not sign up for by setting the cap to 0.
//
// An iterative worklist (a queue on the heap, not the call stack) is
// behaviour-preserving — the same deletions, the same validations, the
// same released set, and the same processing order a queue walks a
// dependency level at a time the same way each level of the recursion did
// — and it removes the stack-depth hazard entirely, independent of
// legacy_maxOrphanTxs. The memory-exhaustion and quadratic-time costs of
// the disabled cap remain and are exactly what the setting's own longdesc,
// and this file's own doc comments, already document as accepted,
// operator-chosen risk; this change does not touch that.
//
// Fix round 1, Issue I2: an orphan is deleted from the pool the moment it
// is promoted (immediately below, before it is appended to released), not
// deferred until it is popped off the queue. This is legacy's own

// very next recursive call into it (:1318) — and it matters for a
// multi-parent orphan: with the deletion deferred (this port's original
// shape), an orphan with two resident parents both promoted in the same
// walk stayed visible to Items() for whichever parent was processed
// second, so it was validated, released and re-queued once per resident
// parent — always more than once for such an orphan, and always
// successfully both times, since this port's breadth-first order promotes
// an entire level (both parents) before descending into either. Legacy's
// own guarantee is only that it never RELEASES such an orphan more than
// once, not that it never validates it more than once: legacy's
// depth-first order can still hit it once with only one of its two parents
// actually promoted so far (a genuine ErrTxMissingParent miss) and once
// more after the other parent lands (the hit that releases it) — "legacy
// validates it once" is true of the lucky interleaving, not a guarantee.
// Deleting immediately makes this port's orphan disappear from Items()
// before any sibling parent's scan can find it again, so it is validated
// exactly once, unconditionally — strictly cheaper than legacy's own worst
// case, not merely matching legacy's best case — and it makes the
