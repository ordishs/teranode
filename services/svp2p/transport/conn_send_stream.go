// MaxBlockFrameBytes is the largest block payload THIS SERVICE will frame with
// a basic message header — `magic(4) + command(12) + length(4) + checksum(4)`,
// whose length field is a uint32 (go-wire writeElements, message.go:404,
// v1.2.10).
//
// It is deliberately one BELOW what that field can hold, because 0xffffffff is
// RESERVED as the extended-message marker. go-wire's own writer draws the line
// in the same place — `if lenpUint32 >= math.MaxUint32` switches to the extmsg
// marker (go-wire WriteMessageWithEncodingN, message.go:391, v1.2.10) — and a
// payload of exactly 0xffffffff framed with a basic header is not merely
// unusual, it is misparsed:
//
//   - SVNode copes. CMessageHeader::Read (src/protocol.cpp:257-263) decides
//     extended by the COMMAND field being "extmsg", never by the length.
//
//   - go-wire does NOT. Its header reader takes the extended branch only when
//     the command IS "extmsg" (go-wire readMessageHeader, message.go:270,
//     v1.2.10), so for command "block" it leaves extLength at 0 — but the
//     payload read then applies `if length == 0xffffffff { length =
//     hdr.extLength }` UNCONDITIONALLY, on both the buffered path (go-wire
//     ReadMessageWithEncodingN, message.go:483-485, v1.2.10) and the streaming
//     one (message.go:634-636). The result is a zero-byte payload read, a
//     checksum computed over nothing and compared against ours, and a
//     desynchronised socket. Every peer on this stack — another svp2p node, or
//     services/legacy — is in that group.
//
//     Note the later `verifyChecksum := length != 0xffffffff && hdr.extLength
//     == 0` (message.go:647) does NOT rescue it: the substitution above has
//     already set length to 0, so the guard is true and the comparison runs.
//
// So the reservation is a real boundary and it belongs in the constant rather
// than in each comparison: a payload AT this value is servable, above it is not.
//
// A larger payload needs SVNode's extended header (src/protocol.cpp:220-237),
// deferred to Phase 4. Until then such a block cannot be served at all.

// SendBlock frames one block message and streams its payload to the socket.
// It blocks until the send finishes or fails, so responses to one getdata stay
// in request order on the calling goroutine.
//
// # Why two passes over the payload
//
// SVNode verifies the payload checksum of every NON-extended message it
// receives (net_processing.cpp:4995-4998) and scores a mismatch against
// dInvalidChecksumFrequency (:5005-5015) — a ban-scored offence, not a log
// line. The checksum is zeroed only on the extmsg path (protocol.cpp:220-237).
// So every block below MaxBlockFrameBytes must go out with a correct
// DoubleHashB(payload)[0:4], and the header precedes the payload on the wire.
//
// The legacy service could only manage that by materializing the whole block
// first (services/legacy/raw_block_message.go:27, io.ReadAll, then
// wire.WriteMessage hashes the buffer), which is the step this service exists
// to drop: a multi-GB block must never be held in memory. Hashing one
// streaming pass and then streaming a second pass to the socket keeps memory
// flat and the checksum exact, at the cost of a second read of the block.
//
// The first pass runs on the CALLER's goroutine, not the writer's: it touches
// no socket, and hashing gigabytes on the single writer would stall every
// other message on this connection for no reason. Only the second pass is
// enqueued for writeLoop, because writeLoop is the sole writer to the socket
// and a header-plus-body written from any other goroutine would interleave
// with whatever it is framing and misalign the connection for good.
//
// # The between-pass guard
//
// The first pass must measure exactly Length bytes, or the send aborts with
// ErrBlockLengthMismatch before anything is written. If the second Open fails
// — the block was reorged out, or its body is no longer served — its error is
// returned unchanged and, again, nothing has been written. Both are safe: the
// caller may answer notfound and the connection is untouched.
//
// The one unrecoverable case is a second pass that ends EARLY, after the
// header is already on the wire. The peer is then waiting for bytes that will
// never arrive and every later frame is misaligned, so the connection is
// failed. A second pass that runs LONG needs no check: exactly Length bytes
// are copied, and those are the same Length bytes the first pass hashed unless
// the store handed back different content for the same block hash.
//
// # Send budget accounting
//
// A streamed block is charged NOTHING against Config.SendBudgetBytes, and
// does not use the priority lane. The budget is the net.cpp nSendSize versus
// GetSendBufferSize check: it bounds the bytes the send QUEUE holds in memory,
// and this payload is never in the queue — it goes from the reader to the
// socket. Charging Send's MaxPayloadLength estimate would refuse every block
// larger than the whole budget; the priority lane would put a multi-GB copy
// behind Config.WriteTimeout, which is a channel-handoff timeout, not a
// transfer budget. The real bound is the peer's own TCP receive window, which
// the copy blocks on — the same backpressure SVNode gets.
//
// The one-block-send-per-connection invariant is enforced by SendBlock being
// SYNCHRONOUS — it returns only once the writer has finished the frame — plus
// the fact that its only caller is a peer's single serve goroutine
// (protocol/getdata.go servePass, which serves at most one block per pass). A
// change that makes SendBlock asynchronous, or calls it from a second
// goroutine, breaks the invariant: nothing else re-establishes it, and two
// concurrent callers would each pay a full hashing pass and then queue two
// multi-gigabyte frames.
