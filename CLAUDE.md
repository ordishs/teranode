# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Teranode is a horizontally scalable BSV Blockchain node implementation using a microservices architecture. It achieves over 1 million transactions per second through distributed processing across multiple machines.

## Common Development Commands

### Build Commands
```bash
# Build main teranode binary with dashboard
make build

# Build without dashboard
make build-teranode

# Build for CI with race detection
make build-teranode-ci

# Build teranode CLI tool
make build-teranode-cli

# Build specific components
make build-chainintegrity
make build-tx-blaster
```

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Run all tests except integration tests
make test

# Run long-running tests
make longtest

# Run sequential tests
make sequentialtest

# Run smoke tests (basic functionality)
make smoketest

# Run all tests
make testall

# Run a single test
go test -v -race -tags "testtxmetacache" -run TestNameHere ./path/to/package
```

### Linting Commands
```bash
# Check only changed files vs main branch
make lint

# Check only unstaged/untracked changes
make lint-new

# Check all files
make lint-full

# Fix gci linting for Go files
gci write --skip-generated -s standard -s default <filename>
```

### Development Mode
```bash
# Run teranode and dashboard in development mode
make dev

# Run only teranode
make dev-teranode

# Run only dashboard
make dev-dashboard
```

## High-Level Architecture

### Microservices Structure
Teranode consists of multiple specialized services communicating via gRPC and Kafka:

**Core Services:**
- **Asset Server** (`services/asset/`): HTTP/WebSocket interface to blockchain data stores
- **Propagation** (`services/propagation/`): Receives and forwards transactions (gRPC/UDP/HTTP)
- **Validator** (`services/validator/`): Validates transactions against consensus rules
- **Block Validation** (`services/blockvalidation/`): Validates complete blocks
- **Block Assembly** (`services/blockassembly/`): Assembles new blocks from validated transactions
- **Blockchain** (`services/blockchain/`): Manages blockchain state and FSM
- **Subtree Validation** (`services/subtreevalidation/`): Validates merkle subtrees

**Overlay Services:**
- **P2P** (`services/p2p/`): Peer-to-peer network communication
- **RPC** (`services/rpc/`): Bitcoin-compatible JSON-RPC interface
- **Legacy** (`services/legacy/`): Backward compatibility with existing Bitcoin nodes

**Data Stores:**
- **UTXO Store** (`stores/utxo/`): Manages unspent transaction outputs (Aerospike-backed)
- **Blob Store** (`stores/blob/`): Stores transactions and subtrees (S3/filesystem)
- **Blockchain Store** (`stores/blockchain/`): Block header and chain state (PostgreSQL)

### Communication Patterns
- **gRPC**: Service-to-service synchronous communication
- **Kafka**: Asynchronous event streaming between services
- **HTTP/WebSocket**: External client interfaces
- **UDP/IPv6 Multicast**: High-performance transaction propagation

### Key Design Patterns
1. **Horizontal Scaling**: Services can be deployed across multiple machines
2. **Event-Driven**: Kafka topics for decoupled communication
3. **UTXO Model**: Bitcoin's unspent transaction output tracking
4. **Merkle Trees**: Binary hash trees for transaction inclusion proofs
5. **Two-Phase Commit**: Distributed transaction consistency

## Configuration

### Settings Files
- `settings.conf`: Default settings and environment-specific overrides
- `settings_local.conf`: Local development overrides (not committed)
- Environment contexts: `dev`, `test`, `docker`, `operator`

### Port Configuration
Services use standardized ports with optional prefixes for multi-node setups:
- Asset Server: 8090
- RPC: 9292
- P2P: 9905
- Blockchain gRPC: 8087
- Validator gRPC: 8081

## Available Agents

Claude will automatically use specialized agents in `.claude/agents/` when appropriate:

- **bitcoin-expert**: Bitcoin protocol, consensus rules, cryptography (automatically consulted for Bitcoin-specific tasks)
- **test-writer-fixer**: Automatically runs tests after code changes
- **api-tester**: API load testing and contract validation
- **backend-architect**: System design and architecture decisions

These agents work together - for example, when implementing a new Bitcoin feature:
1. bitcoin-expert provides protocol guidance
2. backend-architect designs the implementation
3. test-writer-fixer ensures tests pass
4. performance-benchmarker validates performance

## Bitcoin-Specific Context

### Bitcoin Expert Agent
The project includes a Bitcoin expert agent (`.claude/agents/bitcoin-expert.md`) that should be consulted for:
- **Protocol Questions**: Bitcoin consensus rules, script validation, transaction structure
- **Cryptography**: ECDSA signatures, hash functions, Merkle trees
- **BSV-Specific Features**: Restored opcodes, unbounded script sizes, large block handling
- **Implementation Guidance**: When porting bitcoin-sv functionality to teranode

**Usage**: Reference `.claude/agents/bitcoin-expert.md` when working on:
- Transaction validation logic
- Script interpreter implementation
- Consensus rule enforcement
- UTXO management
- Block validation
- Any Bitcoin protocol-specific features

### Key Bitcoin Concepts in Teranode
- ECDSA signatures on secp256k1 curve
- Bitcoin Script (stack-based, Forth-like)
- UTXO transaction model
- Merkle tree block structure
- Proof-of-Work consensus
- BSV's restored opcodes (OP_SUBSTR, OP_LEFT, OP_RIGHT, etc.)
- Unbounded transaction and script sizes

## Testing Strategy

### Test Categories
1. **Unit Tests**: Package-level tests with mocks
2. **Integration Tests**: Multi-service interaction tests
3. **Consensus Tests** (`test/consensus/`): Bitcoin script validation
4. **E2E Tests** (`test/e2e/`): Full system tests with containers
5. **Sequential Tests**: Order-dependent test scenarios

### Test Tags
- `testtxmetacache`: Small cache for testing
- `largetxmetacache`: Production cache size
- `aerospike`: Tests requiring Aerospike

## Development Notes

- Always run linting before commits: `make lint`
- Use `gci` for import formatting in Go files
- Follow existing patterns for new services (check similar services first)
- Protobuf files generate Go code via `make gen`
- Dashboard is a Svelte application in `ui/dashboard/`
- Use TestContainers for integration tests requiring external services
- Don't use mock blockchain client/store - you can use a real one using the sqlitememory store
- Don't use mock kafka - you can use in_memory_kafka.go

## Git Workflow (Fork Mode)

All developers work in forked repositories with `upstream` remote pointing to the original repo.

### Pushing Work
```bash
# Always sync with upstream first
git fetch upstream
git reset --hard upstream/main

# If conflicts occur: STOP and ask user for resolution guidance
# After resolving (or if no conflicts):
git push origin <current-branch>

# Display push result message including PR creation links
```

**Important**: Never auto-resolve merge conflicts. Always show conflicting files and wait for user approval on resolution strategy.

### Creating New Branches
```bash
# Always branch from synced main
git checkout main
git fetch upstream
git reset --hard upstream/main
git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
```

### Quick Reference
- **Push work**: Sync upstream → resolve conflicts (with user approval) → push to fork → show PR link
- **New branch**: Switch to main → sync upstream → create branch
- **Sync with upstream**: `git checkout main && git fetch upstream && git reset --hard upstream/main`
