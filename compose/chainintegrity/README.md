# Chain Integrity Checker

The `Chain Integrity Checker` tool verifies the integrity of a local blockchain generated through testing. It is not intended for use on mainnet.

## Usage

This tool is typically used to ensure the correctness of blockchain data after generating and mining blocks locally. Follow these steps:

1. Remove old data:

   ```shell
   rm -rf data
   ```

2. Run the node for at least 110 blocks:

   ```shell
   docker compose --profile chainintegrity -f compose/docker-compose-chainintegrity.yml up -d
   ```

3. Stop the node after mining 110+ blocks:

   ```shell
   docker compose -f compose/docker-compose-host.yml down teranode-1 teranode-2 teranode-3
   ```

4. Run the chain integrity checker:

   ```shell
   go run compose/cmd/chainintegrity/main.go --logfile=chainintegrity --debug
   ```

5. Cleanup:
   ```shell
   docker compose -f compose/docker-compose-host.yml down
   ```

## Usage with 3 block generators and 3 tx blasters

```shell
# remove the old data
rm -rf data

# run the node for least 110 blocks
docker compose -f compose/docker-compose-3blasters.yml up -d

# stop the node after mining 110+ blocks
docker compose -f compose/docker-compose-3blasters.yml down teranode1 teranode2 teranode3

# run chainintegrity
go run compose/cmd/chainintegrity/main.go --logfile=chainintegrity --debug

# cleanup
docker compose -f compose/docker-compose-3blasters.yml down
```

## Features

- Verify the integrity of a local blockchain.
- Debugging and inspection of blockchain data.
- Logs detailed information for analysis.

## Development

- See `main.go` in the `compose/cmd/chainintegrity` directory for the main logic.
- Run tests with `go test ./...` in this directory.
