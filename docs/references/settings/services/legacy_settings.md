## Configuration Dependencies

### Peer Connection Management

- `ListenAddresses` controls incoming connections (falls back to external IP:8333 if empty)
- `ConnectPeers` forces outgoing connections to specific peers
- When `ConnectPeers` is set, `MaxPeers` automatically set to match count (exclusive mode)
- `ConnectPeers` disables DNS seeding (legacy and svp2p alike; svp2p also skips the fixed-seed fallback and the addrman-driven dialer)
- `SavePeers` controls peer information persistence to disk

### svp2p and the `legacy_config_*` namespace

The svp2p service (`-svp2p=1`, mutually exclusive with `-legacy=1`) reuses the `legacy_*` keys
above so a cutover changes no settings. Three keys the legacy service reads through its
reflective `legacy_config_<Field>` loader have svp2p-owned names: `legacy_disableBanning`,
`legacy_disableDNSSeed` and `legacy_minSyncPeerNetworkSpeed`. svp2p reads the old spelling as
a fallback when the new key is unset and prints
`WARN: setting legacy_config_X is deprecated ... set legacy_Y instead` at startup. The
`legacy_config_*` namespace is removed with the legacy service.

svp2p also honours `excessiveblocksize` at the wire: it is the receive cap for a single block
(blocks over 4 GiB use the SVNode extended message header), and a value of 0 — documented as
"unlimited" for validation — is mapped to the 4 GiB default at the wire, with a warning at start.

### Compact blocks (svp2p)

`legacy_compactBlocks` turns on the BIP152 compact-block RECEIVE path, and nothing else. svp2p
sends `sendcmpct(announce=false, version=1)` once per peer after verack, and it accepts a
`cmpctblock` a peer sends. svp2p never announces a block as `cmpctblock` and never serves one.

`announce=false` tells the peer to keep announcing by `headers` or `inv`. That announce bool is
the FIRST of `sendcmpct`'s two fields and the version is the second
(`net_processing.cpp:2390-2394`; go-wire's `MsgSendcmpct` is `{SendCmpct bool, Version uint64}`),
and it IS BIP152 high-bandwidth mode. There is no separate flag for it.

svp2p also answers NOTHING when a peer asks it for a compact block. A `getdata` for
`MSG_CMPCT_BLOCK` is not a recognised inv type (`services/svp2p/protocol/serving.go:495-505`,
`:336-339`), so the entry draws a warning log and no reply — not even a `notfound`
(`services/svp2p/protocol/getdata.go:246-248`). An inbound `getblocktxn` is refused the same way
(`services/svp2p/protocol/peer.go:843-849`). SVNode falls back to the full block in that case
(`net_processing.cpp:1310-1312`); this port does not. Turning the flag on makes such a request
possible, because SVNode reads our `sendcmpct` as a willingness to provide compact blocks
(`net_processing.cpp:1942-1946`).

Every reconstruction failure falls back to an ordinary `getdata` for the whole block, so the flag
costs bandwidth rather than correctness. It is not free of consequence for the announcing peer: a
`readFailed` costs that peer nothing, and any known holder may then serve the block, but a
`readInvalid` scores it 100 and disconnects it. When that peer was the only known holder, the
block waits for another announcement. See
[svp2p compact blocks](../../../topics/services/svp2p_compact_blocks.md) for the message flow,
the outcome table, and the divergences from SVNode.

`legacy_compactBlocksRecentTxs` sizes `bridge.RecentTxIndex`, the ring of recently seen
transaction hashes that stands in for the mempool SVNode matches short IDs against. Teranode has
no mempool, so the ring is fed by the orphan pool and by the txmeta topic's ADD entries — those
that are neither coinbase nor block-originated, since `services/svp2p/bridge/kafka.go:337-340`
and `:344-351` skip both classes, which is what keeps mined transactions out of the ring. Budget
about 105 bytes per hash: a 32-byte ring slot plus roughly 70 bytes in the dedup map. At the
5,000,000 default that is about 504 MiB of resident heap once the ring is full — a 160 MiB ring
and a ~344 MiB map, measured by `TestRecentTxIndex_FootprintAtDefaultCapacity`. That test LOGS
the breakdown and asserts only loose bounds — a heap delta above 300 MiB and below 1 GiB — and it
is skipped unless `SVP2P_MEASURE_INDEX=1` is set, so no CI run re-checks the 504 MiB figure. A
match adds a
transient 160 MiB copy of the ring for the length of one call. The ring grows into its capacity
as hashes arrive, so a node that never fills it never pays for the whole of it. A value of 0 or
below falls back to the default rather than disabling the index.

Cutover guidance:

- Leave `legacy_compactBlocks` at `false` unless the node has the ~504 MiB of headroom the
  default ring needs, plus the CPU for one pass over the ring per announced block.
- Turn it on for one node first and watch the reconstruction log lines. A low hit rate is not a
  fault: it degrades to one `getblocktxn` that carries most of the block, which is no worse than
  a `getdata`.
- Lower `legacy_compactBlocksRecentTxs` on a memory-tight node before turning the feature off. A
  smaller ring reconstructs less and still saves the round trip on the transactions it holds.
- The index is allocated only when the flag is on, so a node with the flag off pays nothing.

### Feeler Probes

- A feeler is a short-lived probe that connects to an address the node is **not**
  otherwise using, waits for the version exchange to prove somebody is home, marks
  the address as verified, and hangs up. Its purpose is to keep the pool of
  known-reachable addresses from decaying, so a lost peer can be replaced quickly.
- `MaxFeelerPeers` is both the number of probes allowed at once and the number of
  peer slots held back for them. The reservation comes out of the peer-admission
  ceiling (`legacy_config_MaxPeers`, 20 by default), never out of the automatic
  outbound target, so probing can never cost the node a peer it chose to dial.
- Probes start only once the automatic outbound tier is already at its target.
- Selection resolves the address it picks and skips any it cannot resolve, so an
  address this layer has no way of dialling costs one draw rather than the whole
  probe interval. OnionCat addresses are the case that always takes this path:
  the address book accepts them but there is no onion dial path here.
- Feelers switch themselves off, reservation included, in three cases:
  `MaxFeelerPeers` at zero or below; connect-only mode (`ConnectPeers` set); and a
  peer cap too tight to reserve a slot without pushing the admission ceiling below
  the outbound target. Each logs its reason at startup.
- `FeelerHandshakeTimeout` must stay below the peer package's 30-second negotiate
  timeout. If it does not, the peer package hangs up first and a silent host is
  logged at warning as a lost peer rather than being hung up on quietly by the
  probe; values at or above the peer timeout are reduced to 29s with a warning.
  A non-positive value falls back to 25s, also with a warning. Both warnings are
  emitted once, at startup, and the deadline the feeler settled on is on the
  `[Feeler] Starting` line.

### Batch Processing Performance

- Batch sizes and concurrency settings work together for memory and performance control
- `StoreBatcherSize` * `StoreBatcherConcurrency` limits concurrent requests

### Peer Timeout Management

- `PeerIdleTimeout` set to 125s to accommodate 2-minute ping/pong intervals
- `PeerProcessingTimeout` set to 3m for block processing (largest operations)

### Sync Candidate Selection

- When `AllowSyncCandidateFromLocalPeers = false`, only non-localhost peers can be sync candidates
- Prevents local peers from being selected as blockchain sync source

### Block Priority

- `AllowBlockPriority = true`: Enables block priority messages via connection streaming
- Sent via Protoconf message during peer handshake

### Block Prefetch

- `BlockPrefetchBufferBytes` bounds the bytes of received-but-not-yet-processed blocks so download overlaps validation during sync; `0` disables prefetch (synchronous ingestion).
- Big-block era: a block at least as large as the whole budget is admitted alone (weight clamped), giving zero overlap — identical to pre-prefetch behaviour. To get overlap on large blocks, set the budget to at least ~2× the typical block size.
