## Health Checks and System Monitoring

### Service Status

```bash
kubectl get pods -n teranode-operator
```

This command lists all pods in the current namespace, showing their status and readiness.

### Detailed Container/Pod Health

```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n teranode-operator
```

This provides detailed information about the pod, including its current state, recent events, and readiness probe results.

### Configuring Health Checks

In your Deployment or StatefulSet specification:

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:

      - name: teranode-blockchain
        ...
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /health
            port: 8087
          periodSeconds: 30
          timeoutSeconds: 10
          failureThreshold: 3
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /health
            port: 8087
          periodSeconds: 30
          timeoutSeconds: 10
          failureThreshold: 3
          initialDelaySeconds: 40
```

### Viewing Health Check Logs

Health check results are typically logged in the pod events:

```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```

Look for events related to readiness and liveness probes.

### Monitoring System Resources

- Use `kubectl top` to view resource usage:

```bash
kubectl top pods
kubectl top nodes
```

For both environments:

- Consider setting up Prometheus and Grafana for more comprehensive monitoring.
- Look for services consuming unusually high resources.

### Viewing Global Logs

```bash
kubectl logs -n teranode-operator -l app.kubernetes.io/part-of=teranode-operator
kubectl logs -n teranode-operator -f -l app.kubernetes.io/part-of=teranode-operator  # Follow logs in real-time
kubectl logs -n teranode-operator --tail=100 -l app.kubernetes.io/part-of=teranode-operator  # View only the most recent logs
```

### Viewing Logs for Specific Microservices

```bash
kubectl logs -n teranode-operator <pod-name>
```

### Useful Options for Log Viewing

- Show timestamps:

```bash
kubectl logs -n teranode-operator <pod-name> --timestamps=true
```

- Limit output:

```bash
kubectl logs -n teranode-operator <pod-name> --tail=50
```

- Since time:

```bash
kubectl logs -n teranode-operator <pod-name> --since-time="2023-07-01T00:00:00Z"
```

### Checking Logs for Specific Teranode Microservices

Replace `[service_name]` or `<pod-name>` with the appropriate service or pod name:

- Propagation Service (service name: `propagation`)
- Blockchain Service (service name: `blockchain`)
- Asset Service (service name: `asset`)
- Block Validation Service (service name: `block-validator`)
- P2P Service (service name: `p2p`)
- Block Assembly Service (service name: `block-assembly`)
- Subtree Validation Service (service name: `subtree-validator`)
- Miner Service (service name: `miner`)
- RPC Server (service name: `rpc`)
- Block Persister Service (service name: `block-persister`)
- UTXO Persister Service (service name: `utxo-persister`)

### Redirecting Logs to a File

```bash
kubectl logs -n teranode-operator -l app.kubernetes.io/part-of=teranode-operator > teranode_logs.txt
kubectl logs -n teranode-operator <pod-name> > pod_logs.txt
```

Remember to replace placeholders like `[service_name]`, `<pod-name>`, and label selectors with the appropriate values for your Teranode setup.

### Check Services Dashboard**

Check your Grafana `TERANODE Service Overview` dashboard:

- Check that there's no blocks in the queue (`Queued Blocks in Block Validation`). We expect little or no queueing, and not creeping up. 3 blocks queued up are already a concern.

- Check that the propagation instances are handling around the same load to make sure the load is equally distributed among all the propagation servers. See the `Propagation Processed Transactions per Instance` diagram.

- Check that the cache is at a sustainable pattern rather than "exponentially" growing (see both the `Tx Meta Cache in Block Validation` and `Tx Meta Cache Size in Block Validation` diagrams).

- Check that go routines (`Goroutines` graph) are not creeping up or reaching excessive levels.

## Recovery Procedures

### Third Party Component Failure

Teranode is highly dependent on its third party dependencies. Postgres, Kafka and Aerospike are critical for Teranode operations, and the node cannot work without them.

If a third party service fails, you must restore its functionality. Once it is back, please restart Teranode cleanly following the instructions in the [How to Start and Stop Teranode in Kubernetes](minersHowToStopStartKubernetesTeranode.md) guide.

Should you encounter a bug, please report it following the instructions in the [Bug Reporting](../../bugReporting.md) section.
